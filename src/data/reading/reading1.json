            "title": "Optimism and Health",
            "text": "Medical studies are concluding that optimists really do have something to be cheerful about. Coincidental links between optimism and improved general health have been found by researchers. Recently, a Yale University psychologists' study of 660 volunteers aged 50 and above was published. It found that thinking positively about ageing adds an average of seven years to a person's life.\n\nThe team, led by Dr Becca Levy, suggests that having an optimistic attitude can bolster the will to live, though they admit that they cannot explain it fully. Another American research team, however, says they have identified a physical mechanism behind the phenomenon. Their eight-year study of 670 men aged about 63 found that the optimists had significantly better lung function than men who were more pessimistic. This is the first study to show such a link.\n\nThe research team at Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School believes that attitude somehow strengthens the immune system, and that adopting a more positive outlook may reverse physical decline. 'Preliminary studies on heart patients suggest that by changing a person's outlook, you can improve their mortality risk,' says Dr Rosalind Wright.\n\nThe role of optimism in good health has long been noted but often sidelined. Sigmund Freud, the influential psychologist, equated optimism with ignorance, and from 1970 to 2000 there were 46,000 psychology papers on depression and only 40 on joy. Part of that negativity may be blamed on optimists themselves. They are not necessarily fun to have around, says Brice Pitt, the Emeritus Professor of the Psychiatry of Old Age at Imperial College, London. 'Optimists tend to be insufferable people. Always jolly, always up, and, frankly, they have a hopelessly rosy outlook,' he says. 'Depressive people see things as they really are, and that is a disadvantage from an evolutionary point of view. Optimism is a piece of evolutionary equipment that has carried us a long way through millennia of setbacks.'\n\nStudies show that optimists do better than pessimists in work, school and sports, suffer less depression, achieve more goals, respond better to stress and fight disease better. Among people aged from their mid-nineties into their hundreds, researchers generally fail to find consistencies in diet or exercise (and some still smoke). What the super-aged do tend to share, however, is a positive, optimistic outlook.\n\nToshihiko Maruta, of the Mayo Institute, headed an earlier American medical study to find a link between optimism and longevity. Her study found that optimists live about 19 per cent longer than people with grim outlooks. 'It tells us that mind and body are linked and that attitude has an impact on the final outcome: death,' she says. That simple message might have far more effect than exhortations to eat fresh fruit and warnings to stay out of the sun.\n\nDespite the benefits of unprecedented material wealth, the World Health Organisation estimates that depression is soon to become the second leading cause of disability. Popular wisdom blames this on our frenetically busy society. According to social forecasters at the Henley Centre, while people in developed countries are 65 per cent better off financially today than they were 15 years ago, there is no evidence that they are any more content with their lives. While much of this is down to the perception among many of being rushed and pressured for time and space, it is the perception not the reality that counts, they say. The Henley researchers found that if people think they have enough time, space or money, they feel more relaxed about life, regardless of how much of these things they actually have. 'In terms of money, some of the people who \"feel\" wealthiest, and some of those who \"feel\" poorest, actually have almost the same amount of money at their disposal. Their attitudes and behaviour patterns, however, are different from one another' says Chad Wallens, a researcher.\n\nFew studies have tried to ascertain the proportion of optimists in the world. But a 1995 nationwide survey conducted in the USA for the American magazine Adweek found that about half the population counted themselves as optimists, with women slightly more apt than men (53 per cent versus 48 per cent) to identify themselves thus. That attitude drops, however, to less than a third of people between the ages of 55 and 64, which supports research showing that men, in particular, tend to become more irritable as they get older.\n\nLynn Myers, a psychotherapist, points out, however, that too much optimism can be a bad thing: 'You can be what is called a cock-eyed optimist, the sort of person who smokes but is convinced they will never get lung cancer.' Curiously, though, the Brigham & Women's Hospital study found that that optimism was linked to improved lung function even after smoking was taken into account. Myers is skeptical about whether there is a simple way that people can become optimistic in order to improve their health chances. 'I certainly would not suggest that there is anything like \"six easy lessons to change your outlook\". But if you can lower your anxiety levels, it tends to make you more optimistic. Conversely, people who are highly anxious tend to be pessimistic,' she says.",

            "title": "Playing with science",
            "text": "Is science always a serious matter? No, says Pierre Laszlo, who believes that scientists are often just like children at play.\n\nA. The connection between science and play is not often discussed, perhaps because scientists take it for granted, or because they are a little self-conscious about it and therefore try to hide it. In this context, play might describe a number of different activities. Play might involve the exploration of new uses for everyday objects just for curiosity; it could also include word jokes, or the playing of jokes or tricks upon other scientists. The element of play in science is thus an elusive and difficult topic, but it is fundamental to the experience of scientists.\n\nB. One example of this connection is the jigsaw puzzle. Such puzzles present their players with two-dimensional fragments, each with a characteristic shape, from which to reconstruct an overall picture. Guessing the solution of a scientific problem has many similarities to completing a jigsaw puzzle. The scientists inspect each piece of data for a possible fit with its neighbours and, bit by bit, construct a whole argument. People who are good at jigsaw puzzles are able to guess which piece will fit even before trying it. In the same way, the best scientists are those who make the best guesses.\n\nC. But scientists do not play only at out-guessing each other, or at putting together pieces to complete a puzzle. They also regard their work as 'playing' with 'toys'. Joseph Lambert, a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in the US, shed some light on this tendency. In a letter he wrote the following: When I grew up, every kid put in some serious sandbox time, and it often involved building... complex sand structures around which fantasies were composed... The organic chemistry labs at Yale... and chemical transformations took place... The odours were pleasant, and the physical process of working with our hands, as with sand, was satisfying... by the end of the year, I knew that I wanted to be an organic chemist, as I realised one could play in the sandbox for a living. Indeed, many scientists amuse themselves by 'playing with various 'toys' of their trade perhaps coming up with ingenious devices to get a particular job done, or diverting a piece of commercial equipment for novel scientific purposes. The apparatus put together by Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher to measure the charge of the electron, which involved a perfume atomiser bought at a local pharmacy, is a classic example of such inspired tinkering.\n\nD. Whereas society often keeps a lid on playfulness, science encourages and nurtures it. Take, for example, the funny names that scientists have given to various chemical substances: tristane, windowpane, penguinone or megaphone. Each class of organ molecules includes a few such humorous names. Similar fun is had in other fields of science.\n\nE. Hoaxes are a further aspect of the playfulness of scientists. A relatively recent example concerns the 'Plate of Brasse', which stated England's claim to California and was supposedly left by the English navigator Sir Francis Drake during his visit in 1579. A brass plate thought to be Drake's was discovered in the 1930s. But in 1977, Helen Michel and Frank Asaro, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, showed that the copper and zinc used in the plate were of a higher quality than would have been available in the 1500s. They concluded that Drake's plate was most likely crafted much closer to the time when it was first brought to light.\n\nF. Shortly afterwards, staff at the University of California announced that the artefact was devised as a practical joke by a group of friends of Herbert E Bolton, who directed the Bancroft Library at the University's Berkeley campus. Bolton, it seems, was intrigued by tales of Drake having installed a plate to record his visit to California, and often urged his students to look for it. Some of Bolton's friends decided to play a joke on him, but things misfired after Bolton went public and announced that the relic was authentic before he could be told about the joke.\n\nG. Sometimes hoaxes serve a useful purpose. Some years ago, Nathan Lewis, a professor of chemistry at California Institute of Technology, and a graduate student were doing experiments in the laboratory of a senior professor, Harry Gray. Another co-worker had the habit of going through their data and rushing to Gray with his interpretation. Lewis decided to set a trap for the co-worker. He recalls: I manufactured an NMR spectrum. We left it out as bait. Our colleague took it and wrote up a paper on how important this result was. He was ready to go right to the Journal of the American Chemical Society... We didn't let him mail it but this stopped him temporarily from taking our data and interpreting it before making sure that it was right.\n\nH. But is the playfulness of science usually so helpful? One might argue that to play a practical joke is a waste of time. So why do it? Perhaps play is an inherent part of the human condition. The psychologist's answer might be that scientists tend to play because science presents them with too much seriousness. Another possibility might be that scientists like to play because they tend to be very young. Some disciplines, mathematics especially, have a reputation for the narrow window of creativity in youth. But it may also be that there is some cognitive value to the playful element in science. Playing with ideas, after all, is what science is all about. A playful, childlike attitude may be extremely fruitful, and scientists should not be too embarrassed to acknowledge that play is often what motivates them.",

            "text": "Academics are now working more with filmmakers who are impressed by the results of their research in computer generated imagery (CGI). Every year the film academy in the USA celebrates the outstanding achievements of the year in a ceremony known as the Oscars. An increasingly important component of the ceremony is the presentation of the Scientific and Technical awards. In 2004 a notable event took place: the academic world met the cinematographic world when researchers from Stanford University in the USA were awarded an Oscar. These researchers, led by Steve Marschner, were from the field of Computer Graphics at Stanford. They were part of a growing cohort of computer scientists that has become fundamental to moviemaking.\n\nFilms have shown that it is possible to use CGI to make actors look younger, older, weaker or stronger than they actually are in a surprisingly realistic manner. At least, it is possible if the altered actors are not filmed too closely. This is because the difficulty of recreating the textures of both skin and fabric means that the effect is less convincing when seen close up. The work of Marschner and his colleagues has greatly improved the accurate and realistic modeling of both skin and fabric. They recognized that one of the difficulties of creating lifelike characters in the computer world is that in CGI the characters' skin is opaque (two-dimensional) whereas real skin is in fact translucent (three-dimensional), that is to say it is semi-transparent.\n\nMarschner and his colleagues received the Oscar for their work in successfully producing a CGI model that simulates translucency; this is when light penetrates skin and then scatters below the skin's surface before re-emerging. This is called subsurface scattering, and the mathematics for the model goes back many decades to the time when it was used in astrophysics. Because human skin is naturally translucent, it was necessary to be able to create this artificially in order to simulate the soft appearance of real skin. Previous CGI models, which assumed that skin was entirely opaque, resulted in characters with a plastic appearance. The scientists' new model of CGI was so important in bringing digital characters to life that, within two years of their original research paper, all the major special-effects studios had incorporated it into their digital rendering systems.\n\nHowever, despite their award, the scientists, with admirable tenacity, continued their search for perfection, as they still did not feel that they had yet satisfactorily recreated the subtle ways light is reflected. To do this, they began to look in detail at the way skins and fabrics reflect light differently according to their make-up: the exact arrangement of fibers in fabric and the network of fibers in skin. Marschner and his team used computerized tomography to do this - which is most familiar as a medical technique for examining people's internal organs. Like classical radiology it uses X-rays, but because the image is constructed inside a computer using exposures taken from many different positions, rather than a single exposure on photographic film, it can capture fine details that are invisible in classical radiography.\n\nUnfortunately, the scientists understood that at this point in time they could not use computer tomography on skin, because a very high intensity X-ray is needed to show the kind of detail they wanted and this would be very dangerous for human skin. They have, however, had some success with fabric. Using this new method of imaging, they are able to accurately record the three-dimensional structure of all the fibers in a number of small pieces of fabric. These same pieces of fabric, through the use of CGI, can then be patched together to form an entire garment inside a computer, in the same way that a small group of actors can be made to look like hundreds of people gathered together. A garment created through CGI is therefore made up of pieces of fabric whose internal structure has been pre-recorded. This means that the way light is reflected by the garment can be calculated far more realistically than if the scientists just made a computer model of what they thought the interior of the fabric looked like.\n\nCinematography will benefit from this because, although it may take some years to be able to use computerized tomographic imaging of skin, for the moment the movement of a virtual cloak or the lifting of a computerized hat should look far more realistic. In the meantime, according to Marschner's colleague Kavita Bala, the technology might have an application in online retailing. At the moment people buying clothes over the internet have only a standard photograph to help them choose their purchases. It is hoped that if online shoppers can view items which have been presented through the use of computerized tomography graphics, they will have a much better understanding of what the material the item is made of is really like.\n\nMarschner is now working on the way light is scattered from individual hairs. He says, 'I feel lucky to be working in this niche. I'm a visual person and to be able to spend my time scrutinizing the world around me, trying to understand why it looks the way it does, is very rewarding'.",
